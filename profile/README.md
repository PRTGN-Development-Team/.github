## Name Formating

If a dot is infront of PRTGN, I.E. `.prtgn`, then the `prtgn` part is formated lowercase.

If a dot in not infront of PRTGN, I.E. `PRTGN`, then the `PRTGN` part is formated capitlised. 

The only exeption to this is in things such as Rust / Cargo files, where Snakecase is used. Then what would normaly be `PRTGN` may be replaced with `prtgn`. Such as in PRTGN_encoding. The Rust crate version is `prtgn_encoding` insted of `PRTGN_encoding`.
