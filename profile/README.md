## Name Formating

If a dot is infront of PRTGN, I.E. `.prtgn`, then the `prtgn` part is formated lowercase.

If a dot in not infront of PRTGN, I.E. `PRTGN`, then the `PRTGN` part is formated capitlised. 

The only exeption to this is in things such as Rust / Cargo files, where Snakecase is used. Then what would normaly be `PRTGN` may be replaced with `prtgn`. Such as in PRTGN_encoding. The Rust crate version is `prtgn_encoding` insted of `PRTGN_encoding`.

There are two main ways to join the PRTGN Development Team.

### Self Invitation

Send us an email at `prtgn_dev@protonmail.com`!

Provide what you would like to help with and a demonstration of your coding capibility. You may not use fully AI code as a demonstration of your ability. You may use AI assistance in coding, though you need knowledge of Rust. AI cannot genreate good code fully on its own, espeialy in Rust. AI is a useful assistant though it cannot be used for full development.

We are currently looking for people who can use Rust. This project is ment to be all Rust, for web development HTML / CSS / Javascript is fine, though idealy would be switched to Rust, Yew, and Tailwind CSS. 

### Dedication

If we notice you continusosly giving helpful information and or providing helpful code and sugestions, we may ask you if you wish to join the PRTGN Development Team.
